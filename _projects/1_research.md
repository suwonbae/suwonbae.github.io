Our research focuses on applying bottom-up, predictive modeling and simulation to understand the complex behaviors of polymers and develop material design principles for the discovery of multifunctional, high-performance, and advanced polymers.
The increasing demand for such polymers in various applications highlights the need for continuous and accelerated discoveries.
We aim to isolate the effects of parameters and determine structure-morphology-property relations of polymers.

The following images show some of simulations we carried out previously:
