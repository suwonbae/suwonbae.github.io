<p>Welcome to Computational Materials Design Lab!</p>
My name is <strong>Suwon Bae</strong> and I am an Assistant Professor in the [School of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.pusan.ac.kr/new/main/index.asp) at Pusan National University (PNU).
Prior to joining PNU, I was a postdoctoral research associate (PI: [Dr. Kevin Yager](http://yager-research.ca)) in the [Center for Functional Nanomaterials](https://www.bnl.gov/cfn/) at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
I received my Ph.D. degree from Cornell University under the supervision of [Prof. Meredith Silberstein](https://silbersteinlab.com) and B.S. degree from Hanyang University.

Our group aims to understand the complex behaviors of polymers via bottom-up, predictive modeling and then reflect this knowledge to the development of material design principles.

Our research interest stands at the intersection of computational science, applied mechanics, data science, and machine learning for simultaion- and data-driven materials designs.

[comment]: <Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/publications/) automatically.>

[comment]: <Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.>
